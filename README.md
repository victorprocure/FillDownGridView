# FillDownGridView
This is a data grid view that supports filling down in the style of Micosoft Excel.

# Things to do
I'm going to spend some time looking at how to add a context menu to the right click, like the excel style
Also going to look at cleaning up the drawing of the bounding box around the fill down.
Also new events as they are needed
